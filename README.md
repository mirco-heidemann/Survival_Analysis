# Survival_Analysis-
Survival analysis predicts whether an event will occur in a given time period. Statistical methods of analysis include Kaplan-Meier curves, construction of a survival function using survival trees or survival forests, and log-rank tests for between-group comparisons. To estimate the effect of one or more variables on the duration until the event occurs ("survival time"), Cox proportional hazards models are used. These models can be used to fit univariable and multivariable regression with "survival time results."
